Time Tracking
============

Here's how you can use this system to collect objective data on your productivity and work on improving yourself.

 1. Clone this source.
 2. Use The YYYY-MM-DD.ods file as a template for logging every 15-minute interval within your day. Use one file per day.
 3. At the end of each hour, enter the three numbers: green for productive billable 15-minute intervals, red for wasted 15-minute intervals, yellow for 15-minute intervals that were used for something that could be potentially optimized.
 4. When you have filled a few days, run the script "run_timesheet.py". It will create an image file with the graph of your productivity dynamics.
 5. As an added bonus, automate the script-running, so that you cannot miss the brutal truth about your productivity.
 6. Additionally, run snap.py and tick.py in the background - the first one takes screen captures every minute, so that you can review your day, and the second just makes a sound every 15 minutes, to remind you to fill in the timesheet.
